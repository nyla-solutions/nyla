# NYLA DAO

This project is a simple Data Access Object (DAO) abstraction.
There are default implementations for the JDBC based access. 
This project expands on NYLA solution global's Command pattern (a.k.a. COMMAS) for 
data access. This project implements NYLA-solutions's Query Service pattern for database based searches. The object nyla.solutions.dao.SQL is one of the most useful objects as it provides a simple interface to connect and perform JDBC data access (similar to the Spring Data JDBC Template API).
